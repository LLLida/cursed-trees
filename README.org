* Cursed trees

Based on https://youtu.be/WTh-gNZxTM8

* Installation

  You will need C++20 compiler(GCC10+ or Clang10+), cmake and ncurses library.
  Firstly clone the repository:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/LLLida/cursed-trees --recursive
  #+END_SRC

  Then build:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd cursed-trees
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . -j N # N is number of threads that will be used for build, 2-3 will be enough
  #+END_SRC

  By the moment the project is tested only on GNU/Linux but I suppose it will work on any Unix-like system.

* todo

  + Saving/loading system
  + Embedding scripting language(lua?)
  + More complex genom and energy system
